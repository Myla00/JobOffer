<br>
Any hours rendered beyond the eight hours working period for the day will be deemed as overtime which is billed for 25% of their hourly rate.<br>
Any hours rendered during the rest day of the employee will also be computed differently. It shall be paid with additional compensation of 30% of the employees hourly rate. <br><br>
Sample computation for overtime rate during regular working day: <br>
          (normal hourly rate) * 125 = OT per hr<br>
          (OT per hr * number of overtime hours) + daily regular wage = pay for the whole day
          <br><br>

Sample computation for overtime rate during rest day:<br>
          (normal hourly rate) * 130 = OT per hr<br>
          OT per hr * number of overtime hours = pay for the whole day
