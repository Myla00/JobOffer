### <a href="https://blr.dole.gov.ph/2014/12/11/book-iii-conditions-of-employment/"> Normal Working Hours in the Philippines </a>

In the Philippines, the standard work schedule is eight hours per day, with a five-day workweek. This means that employees are typically expected to work eight hours a day, Monday to Friday. <br>

However, there may be times when employees are asked to work beyond these eight hours, such as during busy periods or to meet deadlines. If this occurs, the extra time worked is considered overtime. The same applies if an employee is asked to work on their normally designated day off. In these cases, the additional hours are considered overtime and are compensated accordingly.

When starting a new job, it's common for employees to be hired on a probationary basis. This means that the employer is assessing their performance and deciding if they should become a permanent employee. However, this probationary period shouldn't last longer than six months from the start of employment.
<br>
During this time, the employer may choose to end the employment if they have a valid reason or if the employee doesn't meet the expectations set out by the employer. It's important for these expectations to be clearly communicated to the employee at the start of their probationary period, so they know what they need to do to become a permanent member of the team.

### <a href="https://blr.dole.gov.ph/2014/12/11/book-iii-conditions-of-employment/"> Overtime </a>
<br>
Overtime pay in the Philippines is computed based on the employee's regular hourly rate. For work done beyond eight hours a day, the employee is entitled to an additional 25% of their regular hourly rate. For work done on a rest day, the employee is entitled to an additional 30% of their regular hourly rate. For work done on a special holiday, the employee is entitled to an additional 130% of their regular hourly rate.<br><br>
Sample computation for overtime rate during regular working day: <br>

          (normal hourly rate) * 125 = OT per hr<br>
          (OT per hr * number of overtime hours) + daily regular wage = pay for the whole day
          <br><br>

Sample computation for overtime rate during rest day:<br>
          (normal hourly rate) * 130 = OT per hr<br>
          OT per hr * number of overtime hours = pay for the whole day
